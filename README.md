# ReWear-Community-Clothing-Exchange
ReWear Login Page
Overview
This project contains a simple login page for the ReWear application, a platform focused on sustainable fashion. The page is built using pure HTML and CSS, with minimal JavaScript for form handling and password visibility toggling. It replicates the design and functionality of a React/TSX-based login component, styled with Tailwind CSS-inspired aesthetics.
Features

Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes with a centered layout.
Gradient Styling: Uses gradients for the background, logo, and button to match the ReWear brand.
Password Toggle: Allows users to show/hide the password field with an eye icon.
Form Validation: Basic client-side validation ensures email and password fields are filled before submission.
Navigation: Includes links to home, registration, and forgot password pages (placeholders).
Alert Feedback: Displays success or error messages using alerts (replacing toast notifications).

Setup Instructions

Clone or Download: Obtain the index.html file.
Open in Browser: Open index.html directly in a web browser (no server required, as it uses a CDN for icons).
Ensure Internet Access: The Lucide Icons CDN requires an internet connection to load icons.

Usage

Form Submission: Enter an email and password, then click "Sign In". If both fields are filled, an alert welcomes the user and redirects to a placeholder /dashboard page. If fields are empty, an error alert is shown.
Password Toggle: Click the eye icon next to the password field to toggle between showing and hiding the password.
Navigation Links:
"Back to Home" links to /.
"Sign up here" links to /register.
"Forgot Password?" is a placeholder link (#).


Styling: The page uses a gradient background, a glass-effect card, and hover animations for a modern look.

Customization

Styling: Modify the <style> section in index.html to adjust colors, fonts, or layout.
Icons: Replace Lucide icons by updating the CDN or using a different icon library.
Form Handling: Update the JavaScript in the <script> section to integrate with a backend API for actual authentication.
Links: Update placeholder URLs (/dashboard, /register, #) to point to actual routes.
